### Hi there Rennê Bispo👋
About me

I am a technology enthusiast and software developer with a strong passion for programming. I am constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and take on intriguing challenges. My primary interests lie in web development, both front-end and back-end, as well as artificial intelligence. I have been engaged in recent projects where I have been able to apply and further enhance my skills in these areas.

   Project 1: Calculates the amount of calories a person should consume per day based on certain parameters.
   Project 2: The open-world 2D game is a game that allows players to explore a vast and interactive environment in 2 dimensions.
   Project 3: Tic-tac-toe is a simple board game where two players take turns to mark their symbols on a 3x3 grid.

Hobbies

    🎸 I dedicate time to practicing and improving my musical skills by playing the guitar and the acoustic guitar, expressing creativity and emotions through music. Additionally, my passion for technology       and science fiction leads me to explore books that delve into these subjects, expanding my knowledge and perspective.
    📖 To relax and have fun, I immerse myself in virtual worlds through video games, enjoying engaging narratives, strategic challenges, and social connections with other players.
    🎮 Appreciation for art, advanced graphics, and soundtracks enhance these interactive experiences.
